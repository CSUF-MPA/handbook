	<h2>Mission</h2>
	<p>The mission of the MPA program at CSUF is to prepare our
  students for a career in public service by providing a core set of competencies
  anchored on the foundations of scholarly research and professional practice.
  Our students develop knowledge, skills, and public service values that equip
  them to be ethical and exceptional leaders in their communities who act with a
  commitment to public service, democratic values, accountability, social equity,
  and diversity.</p>

<h3>NASPAA Accreditation</h3>
<p>Our MPA program is accredited by the Network of Schools of
  Public Policy, Affairs and Administration (NASPAA).  As such, the goal of the program is to have
  students acquire the following competencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lead and manage in public governance</li>
  <li>Participate in and contribute to the policy process</li>
  <li>Analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems and make decisions</li>
  <li>Articulate and apply a public service perspective</li>
  <li>Communicate and interact productively with a diverse and changing workforce and citizenry</li>
</ul>
<p>Our program has been accredited since 1989 and was most
  recently reaccredited by NASPAA in 2017.  To learn more about NASPAA, please visit their <a href="http://www.naspaa.org">website</a>.</p>

<h3>General Facts</h3>
<p>CSUF has had a Master in Public Administration program since 1968. Normally we have approximately 100 students with about 30 of those students graduating every year. We are the only public MPA program in Orange County and our alumni are found in most local cities, in many agencies of Orange and Los Angeles counties, and in a wide variety of other governmental and non-profit organizations.  Our MPA  program primarily focuses on helping students in acquiring the critical knowledge, skills, abilities, and core competencies which prepare them for management and leadership positions in the public sector, provide ethical and well-informed leadership, and adapt to changes in the dynamic field of public administration.  </p>

<p>Our typical students have worked full time in a public agency for 3 or more years. They see themselves as people who have the potential to successfully manage others in the agency or city and come here to acquire the tools to do so. Often their supervisors have suggested that they get an MPA. A smaller number are more advanced and have already risen to a leadership position in their unit and seek the MPA as a way of advancing further. We also have a small number of pre-service students.</p>

<p>Our expectation is that most students are full-time employees and part-time students. Because of this, most of our courses are offered from 7:00 to 9:45 PM, once a week, Monday through Thursday.  Our courses are offered in a mix of face-to-face, synchronous online (required weekly Zoom meetings), and hybrid (some required face-to-face meetings, some work done online).  The normal course load is 1-2 courses per semester.  </p>

			<p>We do not currently offer a dual degree with any other programs. </p>

		
<p>The MPA Program is housed in the Division of Politics, Administration &amp; Justice, which itself part of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) at CSUF.  </p>

<h2>Admissions</h2>
<p>We have both Spring and Fall admissions.  Spring admissions typically open on August 1
  and close November 1, while fall admissions typically open on October 1 and
  close April 30.</p>
			
<h4>Addmission Process</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The prospective student applies to the university online at <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/apply">Cal State Apply</a>.</li>
				<li>The MPA admissions website with more detailed information is available <a
href="http://hss.fullerton.edu/paj/PublicAdministration/pa_admissions.aspx">here</a>.</li>
				<li>Additional general information on graduate admissions is
  available <a href="http://admissions.fullerton.edu/prospectivestudent/admissions_graduate.php">here</a>.</li>
			</ul>

<p>You are required to have official transcripts sent to CSUF's Office of Admissions and Records. You must send a set of transcripts from all universities and community colleges you have attended. These should be originals sent from the institution. Further instructions can be found <a
href="http://admissions.fullerton.edu/prospectivestudent/college_transcripts.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a CSUF alum, contact Admissions to see if your official transcripts are still on file.</p>
			
<h4>Prospective Students</h4>
<p>The prospective student must also e-mail all of the following material to the MPA program, includign aset of transcripts from
  all universities and community colleges you have attended (can be unofficial but must be sent directly to the program).</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Statement of Purpose/Interest</li>
		<li> Current resume</li>
		<li> An  <a href="http://hss.fullerton.edu/paj/PublicAdministration/MPA_graduate_admission_checklist.pdf">admissions checklist</a>.</li>
	</ul>
<p> The materials must be sent to  <a href="mailto:mpaadmissions@fullerton.edu">mpaadmissions@fullerton.edu</a>. </p> 

<h4>Admissions Criteia</h4>
<p>Our minimum requirement for GPA is a 2.75 in your undergraduate degree. The average GPA of our accepted students is 3.3 and we typically have far more applicants than we can admit, therefore we cannot accept all students who qualify for the program. We are more likely to admit students if they are already in the public or nonprofit workforce and we take the written statement of purpose as an indicator of the ability to do graduate level writing. Our goal is to admit students whose university record demonstrates their ability and desire to succeed in both their coursework and the public workplace. For all students, how well you performed in your major, any experience in the public or nonprofit sector, the quality of your written statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation. The higher your grades, the less we will need to weigh your supporting documents. GRE scores are not required, but can be sent to the above address if you would like us to consider them in the admissions process. </p>

<h2>Structure of the Program</h2>
			
			<h4>General</h4>
			<p>Conferment of the MPA degree requires 12 courses (36 units) with a ‘B’ average or better (with at least a ‘C’ in all courses) and successful passage of the comprehensive exams in general public administration and in a concentration area.  </p>
			
			<h4> Core Courses</h4>
				<p>Students are required to take courses in </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Introduction to Public Administration</li>
						<li>Organizational Theory</li>
						<li>Research Methods</li>
						<li>Public Finance</li>
						<li>Human Resources</li>
						<li>Local Government</li>
						<li>A capstone seminar, which is taken in the fall semester before comprehensive exams.</li>
					</ul>
			<h4>Concentrations</h4>
			<p>The program has concentrations in human resource management, local government management, public finance, and public policy. Students are required to choose one (and only one) concentration and take courses in that area. Each concentration consists of a total of three courses: 1-2 concentration core courses and 1-2 concentration electives.  </p>
			<h4>Advisor Approved "General Electives"</h4>
				<p>The balance of courses can come from elsewhere in the program or from approved courses in other relate disciplines. Students can take both 400 level courses and 500-level courses, but no more than 50% of total courses can be 400-level courses. Also, not all POSC courses are approved for MPA students. The general rule is that it should be related to administration.  If a class is not on the pre-approved list, it will not be counted toward your degree unless you received approval from the MPA advisor in advance.  See the list of <a href="">approved courses</a>.</p>

			<h4>Comprehensive Exam</h4>
				<p>Students take a comprehensive exam in January of their last semester. The take-home exam consists of two essay questions which assess student knowledge of the general field of public administration and their chosen concentration.  </p>
			<p>All of the core courses and concentration courses must be satisfactorily completed before students may take the comprehensive exam.  </p>
